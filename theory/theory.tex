\section{Inverse Uncertainty Quantification}

Inverse uncertainty quantification (IUQ) is a process
to quantify uncertainties in the input parameters of a computer model,
such as DART, given experimental data.
IUQ is an essential step in computational model validation
because it provides a concrete and quantifiable measure of uncertainty
in model predictions
\cite{wu2018inverse, nagel2019bayesian, wu2021comprehensive}.
The concept of IUQ is in contrast to forward uncertainty quantification (FUQ),
which quantifies the uncertainty in the output of a computer model
given the input parameters.
FUQ is often used to predict the uncertainty in the results of a simulation,
while IUQ is used to quantify the uncertainty in the model itself.
IUQ is often used in engineering and scientific applications
where there is a high degree of uncertainty in the input parameters.
By quantifying the uncertainty in the input parameters,
IUQ can help to improve the accuracy and reliability
of the model predictions \cite{wu2021comprehensive, xie2024functional}.
