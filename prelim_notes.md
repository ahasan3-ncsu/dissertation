# Prelim notes from Beeler 4/4/25

- RRs dont operate at atmospheric pressures. These are typically pressurized water-cooled reactors

- Good background on history on RRs, good lead in to USHPRR monolithic

- Monolithic gets us a much higher fuel loading, this is main reason to convert from dispersion to monolithic. The Zr diffusion barrer is to prevent the interaction layer forming

- Slide 5, have ‘ffuel’ typo

- Can improve the tie in between the DART slide and the GB diffusion slide

- You had an early outline, but I didnt feel like you spent enough time justifying it. If you save the results outline until after the DART slides, it would have also allowed you a point to justify all the work you are doing and how they tie in to each other.  

- Slide 13, typo on temperatures

- Should have mentioned that U diffusion is faster than Mo and that diffusion decreases with Mo content in bulk. Experimentally observed.  

- Slide 16, your are plotting self diffusion, but you are making comparisons to interstitial diffusion in the text? Be careful about the comparisons here

- I feel like we can condense the GB part... Its very thorough, but I dont think it needs to be this in-depth. Maybe better to provide some key findings, and cut some of the ‘lesser’ results. E.g., the slide 19 anisotropy and the diffusivity vs GB energy can probably be cut. I would keep slide 20.

- Slide 20, maybe didnt explain what the view is, and that we are seeing trajectories. Xu commented on this.  

- Slide 23 isnt really needed. Or can be combined with the prior slide.

- I would argue that we generally do understand the fission gas superlattice. There was a BES study that looked at 1-D diffusion and the generation of void superlattices. There are several papers that have been published which are relevant to the U-Mo system.

- There is a reason why they are called heterogeneous vs homogeneous. Its maybe just not clear. But, there is an underlying reason.

- I think the FG superlattice bubbles are more like 2-3 nm diameter bubbles. You stated 4nm.  

- Yeah, we need to cut this talk down. Estimate yourself at a minute (or more) per slide. Thus, you should target 40 slides total for a talk just under an hour.

- Is slide 40 really necessary? If you need it, maybe condense and combine with another slide.

- Did you define MCMC? I dont think so...

- Shouldnt compare against ADP. Should instead compare against the AIMD. Can then also include ADP if necessary. But figure of merit is AIMD.


Questions:

- Xu, asked why U-7Mo instead of U-10Mo. Jahid didnt have a good answer. Needs to improve this. Follow-up on this.

- Jacob Eapen:

- Include more discussion on high T GB diffusion

- Do a g(r) in the GB? Quantify disorder in the GB?

- Xu: have a reference, and a TOC

- Include a contributions slide in the presentation at the end


My other questions that I could ask

- Why did we look at different Mo compositions in the GB work?

- How large are these Xe bubbles? How many Xe atoms are in a given bubble?
