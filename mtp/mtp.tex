\chapter{U-Mo Moment Tensor Potential}

\section{Computational Details}

Various U and Mo phases and alloys are simulated with AIMD
using the Vienna \textit{Ab Initio} Simulation Package (VASP)
\cite{kresse1996}.
The resulting data is then used
to generate an MTP for the two elements with $\lev_{max} = 10$.
To validate this potential,
MD simulations of $\alpha$U, $\gamma$U, bcc Mo, U$_2$Mo, and U-10Mo
are performed with the airm of extracting
lattice constants, radial distribution fucntions (RDFs),
and elastic constants as a function of temperature.
$\alpha$U has an orthorombic crystal structure,
and U$_2$Mo has a tetragonal structure.
The three other simulated systems have a bcc structure.

The LAMMPS software package is utilized for MD simulations \cite{lammps}.
For all simulations,
supercells of $20 \times 20 \times 20$ in lattice units are used.
Each simulations runs for a total of 100 ps.
NPT ensembles are employed,
with anisotropic control of the x, y, and z dimensions.
The length of dimensional length are averaged every 1 ps,
and data from the last 1 ps is used for analysis.
RDFs are computed using the atomic positions
in the last timestep of the simulations.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Lattice Constants}

Figure \ref{fig:latConst} shows
the lattice constants of the five simulated systems.
The lattice constants computed using the ADP potential \cite{beelerADP}
are also shown in the figure.
The lattice constants from the MTP agree with the ADP calculations.
Even for the noncubic systems, such as $\alpha$U and U$_2$Mo,
the MTP is capable of producing comparable results.
Noncubic systems are generally harder to replicate than cubic systems
for interatomic potentials.

\subsection{Radial Distributions Functions}

Figure \ref{fig:rdfs} depicts the RDFs of a select few pair distances
from the simulated systems.
The U-U pair RDFs in $\alpha$U, $\gamma$U, and U$_2$Mo are reported
along with the Mo-Mo pair RDF in bcc Mo.
The RDFs computed using both MTP and ADP display similar characteristics.
The most noticeable discrepancy is observed in the RDFs of U$_2$Mo.
The ADP predicts slightly higher density for the first nearest neighbor
than the second nearest neighbor for U-U pairs,
whereas MTP predicts the same density
for both first and second nearest neighbors.

\subsection{Elastic Constants}

Figure \ref{fig:ecs} displays the elastic constants
$C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{44}$
for $\alpha$U, $\gamma$U, bcc Mo, and U$_2$Mo.
In all cases, the MTP overpredicts the elastic constants
by two to three times compared to the ADP.
Thus, the simulated system with the MTP
is significantly more rigid than expected.
This will lead to simulations of systems with
inaccurate mechanical properties, defect energies,
and provide unrealistic phase stability.
Given that the training data for the MTP came from
simple AIMD simulations of U and Mo systems without any deformation,
it is fair to assume that the potential is lacking training
with descriptors of deformed configurations.

\section{Discussion}

The MTP demonstrates considerable promise in its capabilities
to predict stable cystal structures involving U and Mo.
However, it cannot predict elastic constants well.
Therefore, further training is needed to make it usable.
Also, more testing is required to assess
if the MTP can accurately predict formation energies, melting points,
and other thermodynamic properties.
Following the validation of the two-element potential,
our next step will be to incorporate a third element (Al or Zr) to the MTP.
