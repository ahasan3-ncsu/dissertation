\section{GB Diffusion}

In the present work, MD simulations are performed using an ADP potential
to compute the GB diffusion coefficients of U, Mo, and Xe
in $\gamma$U-Mo alloys \cite{starikov2018}.
First, the GB region is identified by locating the lattice point jumps
of atoms using the atomic trajectories.
It is observed that the GB width increases almost linearly
from around 6 \r{A} to around 12 \r{A} with temperature
in the range 600 K - 1200 K.
The MSDs of the U, Mo, and Xe atoms are then used to calculate
the GB diffusivities of the species in several $\gamma$U-Mo alloys
($\gamma$U-7Mo, $\gamma$U-10Mo, and $\gamma$U-12Mo)
as a function of temperature and misorientation angle.
The GB diffusion coefficients are typically
on the order of $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-11}$ m$^2$s$^{-1}$.
The U GB diffusivity is always higher than the Mo GB diffusivity
for a specific GB at a given temperature.
The Xe GB diffusivity is closer to the Mo GB diffusivity around 600 K
and it steadily approaches the U GB diffusivity with increasing temperature.
The GB diffusion coefficients parallel to the tilt axis of the GB plane
are generally larger than the coefficients perpendicular to the tilt axis,
with some specific GBs showing significant anisotropy.
The orientation-averaged GB diffusion coefficients parallel to the tilt axis
are used to evaluate the effect of composition.
There is a significant negative correlation
between the GB diffusivities and the concentration of Mo in the alloy.
The orientation-averaged diffusion coefficients of U, Mo, and Xe
are between three to fifteen orders of magnitude faster
than the intrinsic/self-diffusion coefficients of the species in the bulk,
and GB diffusion dominates the effective diffusion of the material
at lower temperatures.
The diffusional acceleration by GBs is the most prominent for Xe,
and a quantitative account of this will improve
the understanding of the fission gas swelling behavior.
The calculated diffusion coefficients will also inform
models of creep mechanisms.
Overall, the results obtained from this work will provide insight
into the various phenomena related to the fuel performance
of the $\gamma$U-Mo fuels.

\section{Xe gas bubble re-solution}

This study utilized MD simulations
to determine the re-solution rate of Xe gas bubbles in $\gamma$U-10Mo fuel.
Both the homogeneous and heterogeneous re-solution mechanisms
were investigated using PKA and thermal spike simulations.
However, homogeneous re-solution was found negligible
in describing the overall re-solution behavior.
On- and off-centered thermal spikes were both simulated to obtain
the spatial correlation between re-solution and thermal spike distance.
The Xe/vacancy ratio in the bubble was also varied
to better understand the role of bubble pressure.
Additionally, the electronic stopping power
of fission products (Xe and Sr) in $\gamma$U-10Mo was simulated
to determine the distance-dependent electronic stopping power.
All this information was then used to calculate
the overall re-solution rate of Xe gas bubbles in the fuel.
The re-solution rate of intragranular Xe gas bubbles
under equilibrium pressure in $\gamma$U-10Mo
was found to be on the order of $10^{-4}$--$10^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
for a fission rate of $10^{14}$ fissions/cm$^3$/s.
An analytical form of re-solution rate---dependent on
bubble radius, bubble pressure, and fission rate---was also provided.
The outcomes generated by this work will inform
higher-length-scale models of $\gamma$U-10Mo
with a physics-based description of the Xe gas bubble re-solution rate.

\section{Inverse UQ}

This work establishes a way
to perform IUQ on unknown fission-gas-behavior parameters of $\gamma$U-Mo
utilized in DART.
A dataset compiled from 3200 DART simulations are used for the study.
Only three parameters ("dGrainHBS", "FaceCovMax", and "SwellLink") out of seven
affects the fission gas swelling value in a significant way.
The other four parameters are inconsequential.
For surrogate modeling, GP with an RBF kernel is found to work the best.
MCMC sampling with this surrogate leads to
converged posterior probability distributions for the three parameters.
Forward propagations using these posteriors provide a way
to verify the whole process as well.
