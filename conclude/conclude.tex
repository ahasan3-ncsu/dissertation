\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Xe re-solution study needs more work.
It is possible that the homogeneous mechanism of re-solution
is not negligible compared to the heterogeneous mechanism.
The two-temperature model will be employed
to quantify the amount of energy transferred
from the electronic subsystem to the ionic subsystem.

\item
The IUQ process will be extended to the newly generated data,
which takes into account variable fission rate and grain size.
Surrogate models will be built for the new dataset,
and IUQ will be performed again
to better quantify more fission-gas-behavior parameters.

\end{itemize}
