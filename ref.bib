	ABSTRACT = {A U-Mo alloy has been selected as the fuel design for the
	            conversion of high-performance research reactors in the United
	            States. Efforts are ongoing to describe the fuel evolution as a
	            function of time, for a variety of different reactor conditions.
	            The accurate prediction of fuel evolution under irradiation
	            requires the implementation of correct thermodynamic properties
	            into mesoscale and continuum-level fuel performance modeling
	            codes. Molecular dynamics has proven to be a valuable tool to
	            parameterize or inform these higher-length scale models. However,
	            there are currently inaccuracies in the only available U-Mo-Xe
	            potential, which limits the predictive capabilities of molecular
	            dynamics to inform critical phenomena in these fuel systems such
	            as fission gas swelling. This work provides an updated U-Mo-Xe
	            ternary interatomic potential which combines existing potentials
	            in a reconciled format. The validation of the interatomic
	            potential is performed by analyzing the phase stability and
	            vacancy formation energies. Subsequently, Xe solution energies
	            and an equation of state to describe Xe bubbles in U-Mo are
	            calculated, providing 1) evidence of the significant differences
	            between the prior ternary potential and the currently presented
	            potential, and 2) updated data/tools for implementation into
	            mesoscale simulation methodologies to study fission gas bubble
	            evolution.},
